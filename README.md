# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to test the beta site for PlanMyTripp app and adding weather descriptions.  This feature is the perfect add on especially in tourism to give the consumer an opportunity to book travel based on climate and weather conditions.  For the sake of this excercise, I set parameters to the min/max temperature location that I would be most interested in traveling.   Three steps broken down below are:   retrieving weather data, creating a customer travel destination map and creating a travel itinerary map.

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

- Retrieve all of the following information from the API call.
  - Latitude and longitude
  - Maximum temperature
  - Percent humidity
  - Percent cloudiness
  - Wind speed
  - Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)

- Add the weather data to a new DataFrame 

- Export the DataFrame as WeatherPy_Database.csv into the Weather_Database folder

- Weather Data Folders Inlcuded:
    - The Weather_Database.ipynb file
    - The WeatherPy_Database.csv file


## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map



## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
