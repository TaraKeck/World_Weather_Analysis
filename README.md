# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to test the beta site for PlanMyTripp app and adding weather descriptions.  This feature is the perfect add on especially in tourism to give the consumer an opportunity to book travel based on climate and weather conditions.  For the sake of this excercise, I set parameters to the min/max temperature location that I would be most interested in traveling.   Three steps broken down below are:   retrieving weather data, creating a customer travel destination map and creating a travel itinerary map.

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data



## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map



## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
